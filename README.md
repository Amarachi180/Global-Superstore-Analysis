## Analysis

### Question 1  
### a)	What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?  
### b)	For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?  

In 2014, the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore were the United States ($93.51K), India ($48.81K), and China ($46.79K). These countries contributed significantly to the company’s overall profitability, indicating strong market performance in North America and Asia.  
In the USA, the Canon imageClass 2200 Advanced Copier with a total profit of about 15.68 thousand, followed by Hewlett-Packard Laser Jet 3310 Copier of about 3.62 thousand, and GBC DocuBind TL300 Electric Binding System of about 1.91 thousand, generated the highest total profit in 2014(Top 3 products)  
In India, the “Sauder Classic Bookcase, Traditional” (total profit of about 2.42 thousand), “Cisco Smart Phone with Caller ID” (total profit of about 1.61 thousand), and “Hamilton Beach Refrigerator, Red” (total profit of about 1.44 thousand), are the top three products generating the highest total profit for 2014.  
In China, “Sauder Classic Bookcase, Metal” (total profit of about 1.46 thousand), “Bush Classic Bookcase, Mobile” (total profit of about 1.22 thousand), and “HP Copy Machine, Color” (total profit of about 1.2 thousand) generated the highest total profit in 2014.  

### Question 2  
### a)	Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States  

In the United States, the top three subcategories with the highest average shipping costs are Copiers, Machines, and Tables. Copiers incur the highest average shipping cost at $165.29, followed by Machines at $132.25, and Tables at $69.95. These figures suggest that heavier or bulkier items, such as office equipment and furniture, significantly increase logistics expenses. Businesses should consider these costs when pricing or planning inventory for the U.S. market.  

### Question 3  
### a)	Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries?  
### b)	What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.  

In 2014, Nigeria’s profitability was very bad with the total profit of about (- $23.29 thousand) in negative. Comparing Nigeria to other African countries, Nigeria has the lowest negative profit margin. Uganda and Zimbabwe are also non-profitable countries. Among the bottom 10 profitable countries in Africa, the last three countries are not profitable: Uganda, followed by Zimbabwe and Nigeria.The highest profitable country in Africa is South Africa, with a total profit of about 9.36 thousand.  
Nigeria’s poor performance is rooted in its high average discounts (0.7) offers to its customers; this is the same for Uganda and Zimbabwe, with their average discounts the same as Nigeria’s. The Shipping costs of the African countries don’t affect their performance.  

### Question 4   
### a)	Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia. Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.  
### b)	Is there a specific country in Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the subcategory identified in 4a?  

In Southeast Asia, 94.12% of subcategories were profitable, contributing a combined 104.37% to the region’s total net profit. Only one subcategory (5.88%) was unprofitable, causing a negative impact of −4.37% on overall profit. Among the profitable subcategories, Furnishings recorded the lowest profit, contributing $46,967.43, which accounts for just 3.20% of the total subcategory profit. This highlights Furnishings as the least profitable, despite being in the profitable category.  
In Southeast Asia, the Furnishings subcategory performed poorly in Thailand and Myanmar (Burma), generating losses of $184.03 (21.89%) and $120.63 (14.36%), respectively. Together, these two countries accounted for over 36% of the total ‘Furnishings’ loss in the region. Given their consistent negative contribution, Global Superstore should consider discontinuing the Furnishings subcategory in these markets to minimize further losses and focus on more profitable regions.  

### Question 5  
### a)	Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders.  
### b)	Why is this city’s average profit so low?  
After removing all cities with fewer than ten orders, the analysis shows that Plantation has the lowest average profit in the United States, with an average profit of only 1.09. Although Plantation meets the minimum order requirement with eleven orders, its profit remains extremely low compared to other cities.  A key reason for this poor performance is the influence of heavy discounting, which significantly reduces the revenue gained per order. When discounts are high, the selling price drops, and the remaining margin becomes very small. As a result, even if sales volume is adequate, the profit generated from each transaction is too low to improve the city’s overall performance. This heavy reliance on discounts is the main factor contributing to Plantation’s position as the least profitable city in the analysis.  

### Question 6  
### a)	Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?  
In Australia, the Appliances subcategory generated the highest average profit among all product subcategories, with a value of $139.01. This indicates that Appliances are the most profitable subcategory in the region, outperforming others such as Copiers ($105.06) and Phones ($98.32). This strong performance suggests that Appliances could be a strategic focus area for maximizing profit in the Australian market.

### Question 7  
### a)	Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?  
An evaluation of customer value based on both total sales and profit shows that the most valuable customers are Tamara Chand, Tom Ashbrook, and Hunter Lopez. These customers consistently appear among the top performers in both sales and profit, indicating that they not only buy frequently but also generate strong profit margins for Global Superstore. Tamara Chand leads as a high contributor across both metrics, purchasing high-value items such as machines and phones. Tom Ashbrook also emerges as a significant customer with strong purchasing activity and sizeable profit contribution. Hunter Lopez follows closely, contributing notably to both revenue and profit through consistent purchases. These three customers represent the core of Global Superstore’s high-value clientele.

## Conclusion & Recommendations
### Conclusion
In 2014, Global Superstore experienced its strongest performance in the United States, India, and China. These markets not only delivered the highest total profit but also demonstrated consistent customer demand for high-ticket items like copiers, bookcases, and machines. Conversely, Nigeria and other African countries underperformed due to high discount rates. Southeast Asia mostly performed well, but specific subcategories and countries like Furnishings in Thailand and Myanmar proved unprofitable.
High shipping costs in the U.S. for bulky items like copiers and machines suggest a need for careful logistical planning. In Australia, Appliances stand out as a key profitability driver, and in terms of customers, a small group of high-value clients’ accounts for a large share of profit.  

### Recommendations  
**1.	Market Optimization:**  
i.	Continue prioritizing the U.S., India, and China as core markets.  
ii.	Discontinue unprofitable subcategories (e.g., Furnishings) in Thailand and Myanmar.  
**2.	Customer Strategy:**  
i.	Offer loyalty programs or premium services for high-value customers like Sean Miller and Tamara Chand to retain and further engage them.  
ii.	Analyze purchasing patterns of these top clients to inform marketing and product planning.  
**3.	Profitability Improvement in Africa:**  
i.	Reevaluate discount strategies in Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Consider reducing discount levels or offering promotions selectively.  
ii.	Explore operational efficiencies since shipping costs were not the issue.  
**4.	Cost Management:**  
i.	In the U.S., revisit shipping and warehousing strategies for high-cost items to reduce logistics expenses without sacrificing service.  
**5.	Product Focus:**  
i.	Invest more in profitable subcategories in each region (e.g., Appliances in Australia, Copiers in the U.S.).
